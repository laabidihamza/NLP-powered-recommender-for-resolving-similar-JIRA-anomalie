Steps to reproduce\\r\\n # Configure Artifactory to use Atlassian Crowd as authentication provider.\\r\\n # Import/sync some (Crowd) groups to Artifactory\\r\\n # Login to Artifactory web UI as a Crowd user with some (Crowd) group permissions that has been imported & configured to Artifactory\\r\\n # Verify that user details shows the groups associated for the user just logged in\\r\\n # Use another browser or browser private window for another session to Artifactory web UI, and make a new login to Artifactory, but now give wrong password\\r\\n\\r\\nh3. Expected behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second login fails but the first session remains with the same permissions.\\r\\nI.e. failed login would not remove any groups & permissions.\\r\\nh3. Actual behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nThe failed login triggers removal of all Crowd groups from the user and the permissions are lost.\\r\\nOnly re-login repopulates the groups & permissions to the user.\\r\\nh3. Additional information\\r\\n\\r\\nIf authentication provider is LDAP (AD), failed login won't remove groups. Similar behavior is expected when Crowd is used as authentication provider.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis issue can cause issues in builds, which can be very tricky to resolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no reason why failed login would trigger group & permission removal. Only successful login with successful data sync should change user's groups & permissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a security aspect, an attacker can use this to block Crowd user to use Artifactory by giving known username and wrong password.\",\n          \"Got internal error when trying to log-in.
